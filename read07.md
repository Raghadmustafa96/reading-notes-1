## What is a script:
### A script is a series of instructions that a
a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
## How to write a script:
### To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it.
### To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).


# EXPRESSIONS
## An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking

## there are two types of expressions :
> EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE
>EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE-VALUE.

# OPERATORS
## Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
>  ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS (=)
> COMPARISON OPERATORS (< , >, ==)
> ARITHMETIC OPERATORS(- , * , / ,  +)
> LOGICAL OPERATORS(and, or, nor)
> STRING OPERATORS ( + )

# FUNCTION
## Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
# Declering a function :
## To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed ta achieve its task inside the curly brace and the function can by calling any time you want and you can declare a function that takes information and you can get a value back from at by using a return.
