# Comparison operators
## to evaluate a situation, the result will be true or false. 
1  - is equal (==)
2  - is not equal (!=) 
3  - strict equal (===)
4  - strict not equal (!==)
5  - greater than (>)
6  - less than (<)
7  - greater than or equal (>=)
8  - less than or equal (<=)

# Logical operators
## Return a single value of true or false.
*  logical and (&&)
*  logical or (||)
*  logical not (!)

# Loops 
## loops will repeat the code until the condition be false.
*  For
*  While
*  Do While

##  loops counter using in for and this number indicates how much time it will repeat
*  Initialization
* condition
* update

## WHILE LOOPS
### The key difference between a whi 1 e loop and a do whi1e loop is that the statements in the code block come before the condition. This means that those statements are run once whether or not the condition is met.
