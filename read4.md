# HTML  
## HTML is used to create web pages. You will see that you start by writing down the words you want to appear on your page. You then add tags or elements to the words so that the browser knows what is a heading, where a paragraph begins and ends, and so on
# CSS 
## CSS uses rules to enable you to control the styling and layout of web pages.
# How People Access the Web ?
- Browsers
- Web Servers
- Screen readers
- Devices
# How Websites Are Created?
## All websites use HTML and CSS, but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies into the mix.
# How the Web Works?
## When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.
# Who is the Site For 
## Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.
# Why People Visit YOUR Website
## Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason.

# What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve
## It is unlikely that you will be able to list every reason why someone visits your site but you are looking for key tasks and motivations. This information can help guide your site designs.

# What Information Your Visitors Need
## You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively.

# Structure  
## In all kinds of documents, the structure is very important in helping readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey and to navigate around the document. So, in order to learn how to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to structure documents. HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages. Let's look closer at the code from the last page. There are several different elements. Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag.

# Traditional HTML Layouts 
### For a long time, web page authors used \< div> elements to group together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes to indicate the role of the \< div> element in the structure of the page. HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.
- Headers & Footers
- Navigation
- Articles
- aside
- section
- hgroup
- Figures
- div
# Helping Older Browsers Understand 
### Older browsers that do not know the new HTML5 elements will automatically treat them as inline elements. Therefore, to help older browsers, you should include the line of CSS on the left which states which new elements should be rendered as block-level elements.

# The Evolution of HTML 
### Since the web was first created, there have been several different versions of HTML (HTML4, HTML5).
## DOCTYPEs 
### Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included).
## Comment nts in HTML 
### If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters:  \< !-- comment goes here -->
## ID Attribute 
### Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page.
## class attribute 
### Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.
## Block Elements 
### Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements.
## Inline Elements 
###  Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements.
## span 
### The \< span> element acts like an inline equivalent of the <div> element.
## iframe 
### An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame.
