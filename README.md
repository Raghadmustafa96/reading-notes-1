# growth mindset
In these days, I think that all of us should try to improve our self by change our thinking ways.
So this led us to new concept we call it this day **_the growth mindset_**.
A growth mindset believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through effort.
*Intelligence* and *talent* are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.
